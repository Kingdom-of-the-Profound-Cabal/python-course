Welcome to our comprehensive Python programming course!


This is the repository for The python Course published by [KPC Team](https://github.com/Kingdom-of-the-Profound-Cabal). It contains all the course code.

## Requirements and Setup

if you want to learn from your web browser you can use [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index) <br>

If you want to use your own pc please follow the instructions below:
- Install Python on [Windows/Mac/Linux](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Install pip for [Windows/Mac/Linux](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
- Donwload the code editer, there are several <b>we recommend</b> [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## What You Will Learn

This course was designed to provide you with a solid foundation in the Python programming language, as well as an understanding of its advanced features and capabilities. We will start by covering the basics of the Python language, including data types, variables, control structures, functions, and modules, you’ll then learn about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and how to use classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to design and implement complex programs, we will also dive into data structures and algorithms and see how we can implement them in Python and how to use them to store and manipulate data. You'll gain an understanding of common algorithms and how to use them with Python. will learn how to work with files, read and write data from different file types, such as JSON files, and how to address problems. We will look at range of Python's standard libraries and what is frequently used. We will also focus on writing clean code, including the best practice for making code easy to read, maintain and document, to improve your teamwork, code re-usability and efficiency.

* [**Lec 00 – INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON**](https://github.com/Kingdom-of-the-Profound-Cabal/python-course/blob/main/Lec-0.ipynb) 

    Review of the Python programming language that covers general information and cool info about the language.

* [**Lec 01 – BASIC SYNTAX**](https://github.com/Kingdom-of-the-Profound-Cabal/python-course/blob/main/Lec-1.ipynb) 

    in this lecture we explain the <b>variables</b>, <b>typing operation</b> and <b>condetions</b>.

* [**Lec 02 – FUNCTIONS & LOOPS**](https://github.com/Kingdom-of-the-Profound-Cabal/python-course/blob/main/Lec-2.ipynb) 

    in this lecture we explain <b>functions</b>, <b>decorators</b> which are a used to organize and structure code, making it more readable and reusable, <b>control statements</b> and <b>Loops</b> which are used to perform a specific set of instructions multiple times.

* [**Lec 03 – OOP**](https://github.com/Kingdom-of-the-Profound-Cabal/python-course/blob/main/Lec-3.ipynb) 

    in this lecture we explain OOP concepts such as classes & obejts, abstractions and polymorphism with some advanced concepts all examples.

* [**Lec 04 – DOCUMENTING**](https://github.com/Kingdom-of-the-Profound-Cabal/python-course/blob/main/Lec-4.ipynb) 

    in this lecture we explain how you can Document your code and make it more clear.

* [**Lec 05 – ERROR HANDLING**](https://github.com/Kingdom-of-the-Profound-Cabal/python-course/blob/main/Lec-5.ipynb) 

    in this lecture we explain how ypu can deal with errors and handle them before it the your code crash and we looked into how you can make your own cudtom error to make it errier to handle.

* [**Lec 06 – STANDARD LIBRARIES**](https://github.com/Kingdom-of-the-Profound-Cabal/python-course/blob/main/Lec-6.ipynb) 

    in this lecture we explored some of the Standard Libraries built in with python.

* [**Lec 07 – 3RD PARTY**](https://github.com/Kingdom-of-the-Profound-Cabal/python-course/blob/main/Lec-7.ipynb) 

    in this lecture we explored some of the 3rd party Libraries thet can be used in python, and go through Virtual environment and how to use them.
